You've arrived at Heaven's Forge!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A rich orange sun bobs upon a starry sea of violet, flanked by the remnants of an abandoned dyson sphere. An edifice of
ancient and ingenious artifice, the crumbling construct cast a shadow upon the star's light that allows for safe
approach. Thirteen ringed mirrors of burnished gold encircle the sun, a clockwork cage of gilded glass drinking up the
bronze, buttery glow. Even though the incomplete structure covers only a quarter of the star, this station produces an
endless supply of coveted hardlight. This rare resource is treasured universally for its lightweight durability and
flexibility, particularly for building spacefaring vessels. The Shipyards of Heaven's Forge are renowned among all the
Seven Suns, and it is held in belief that this place was the beginning of Captain Kip's legendary voyage. It has since
become a point of pilgrimage for both builders and explorers. Diligent robots attend to the foundry floor before you.
